This app is a To-Do-List App where users can manage their tasks by checking them off once completed. Data is stored in the user's local device using AsyncStorage. I am currently working on more features such as adding a calendar and setting priorities. It is currently available on Appstore: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/checked-to-do/id1577767478#?platform=iphone

### More about the Project

The list of tasks is organized in a way that the checked tasks move to the bottom, so the user would see the unchecked tasks first then the checked tasks.
