This project is a single player Hangman game. It follows the MVC(Model-View-Controller) design pattern to separate the program logic. I utilized ASCII code to process keyboard inputs. The C++ version simply uses the print prompt for the animation, but the JS version utilizes HTML canvas drawing. I am currently working on the multiplayer version. 

### More about the Project

The user is given ten chances to guess the word.

C++ version: This runs on the user's terminal. This version is a two-player game that one person will enter a word at the beginning of the game, and the other will guess the word. 

Javascript version: This runs as a web application. Click any button to enter an alphabet to guess the word.
