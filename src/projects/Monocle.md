Monocle is a software that summarizes lengthy privacy policy documents down to the most important information regarding safety and privacy of the user. It displays information such as what data they collect, the purpose of data being collected, how it is stored, and affiliated companies who have access to the data. It also highlights the subsections of the privacy policy that includes the keywords. The frontend was built using React, backend with Python and Flask, and Firebase as the database. The frontend handles the input and passes to the backend, and the backend processes the privacy policy document, which is then fetched back from the frontend via axios. The simplified data is then processed and displayed in the frontend.
