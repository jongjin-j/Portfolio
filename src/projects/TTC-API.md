This project is an API that provides information about all the TTC(Toronto Transit Commission) subway stations, such as the line number, address of the station, average ridership, and many others. It has a function to add more stations to the API in case more train stations are built later on. It is connected to a database in mongoDB Atlas.

### More about the Project

In the app, the user can either view the entire API consisting of all the TTC stations or choose a single API to view. The list of the APIs are in alphabetical order. The "Add Station" button allows the user to add a TTC station by filling in information about the station.
